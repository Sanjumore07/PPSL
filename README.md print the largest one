The program prompts the user to enter three numbers.
It then compares the three numbers to find the largest one using a series of if statements:
   - If 'a' is greater than or equal to both 'b' and 'c', it prints that 'a' is the largest number.
   - If 'b' is greater than or equal to both 'a' and 'c', it prints that 'b' is the largest number.
   - If 'c' is greater than or equal to both 'a' and 'b', it prints that 'c' is the largest number.
The program then displays the largest number among the three input numbers.
 Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
