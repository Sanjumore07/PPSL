 The code begins by including the necessary libraries: iostream for input/output operations and vector for using a dynamic array-like structure.
 Inside the main function:A vector named `numbers` is initialized with a predefined list of integers.Three variables are declared to store the sum of numbers, the count of even numbers, and the count of odd numbers.
 The code then iterates through each number in the `numbers` vector using a range-based for loop:It calculates the sum of all numbers.It increments the `evenCount` if the number is even (divisible by 2) and `oddCount` if it's odd.
 After analyzing all numbers, the code calculates the average by dividing the sum by the total number of elements in the `numbers` vector.
The program then displays the following results:The list of numbers in the vector.Analysis results including the sum, average, count of even numbers, and count of odd numbers.
Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
