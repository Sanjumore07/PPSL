 he code snippet starts with including the iostream library, which allows input and output operations in C++.
The line `using namespace std;` indicates that the code is using the standard namespace for C++.
Inside the main function, an integer variable `number` is declared to store the user input.
The program prompts the user to enter a number by displaying the message "Enter a number: " using `cout`.
The user input is then read and stored in the variable `number` using `cin`.
The code then checks if the entered number is greater than or equal to 0. If the number is non-negative (greater than or equal to 0), it displays a message indicating that the number is positive.
If the number is negative (less than 0), the program displays a message indicating that the number is negative.
Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution of the program.
