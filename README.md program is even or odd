The program prompts the user to enter a number.
 It then applies the logic to check if the number is even or odd:
   - If the number divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 0 (i.e., a % 2 == 0), the program outputs that the given number is even.
   - If the number divided by 2 leaves a remainder other than 0, the program outputs that the given number is odd.
The program then displays the result indicating whether the given number is even or odd.
 Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
