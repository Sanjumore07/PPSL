 The program includes the necessary header file `<iostream>` for input and output operations and uses the `std` namespace for standard C++ library functions.
In the `main()` function:
   - It declares an integer variable `number` to store the user input.
   - Asks the user to enter an integer using `cout`.
   - Reads the entered integer from the user using `cin` and stores it in the `number` variable.
   - Displays the entered integer back to the user using `cout`.
Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
