The program first prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /) followed by two numbers.
It then uses a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the entered operator:If the operator is '+', it adds the two numbers.If the operator is '-', it subtracts the second number from the first.If the operator is '*', it multiplies the two numbers.If the operator is '/', it divides the first number by the second. If the operator is none of the above, it displays an error message indicating that the operator is incorrect.
 The program then outputs the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation or the error message if the operator is inFinally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
