 The program prompts the user to enter the dividend (the number to be divided) and the divisor (the number by which the dividend will be divided).
It then calculates the quotient by dividing the dividend by the divisor using the '/' operator and calculates the remainder using the '%' (modulus) operator.
 The program then displays the calculated quotient and remainder to the user.
 Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
