Iterative Factorial Function:The function `factorialIterative` calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n` using an iterative approach. It initializes a variable `result` to 1 (as the factorial of 0 is 1).It then iterates from 1 to `n`, multiplying the `result` by the loop index in each iteration.Finally, it returns the computed factorial.
Recursive Factorial Function: The function `factorialRecursive` calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n` using a recursive approach. It has a base case that returns 1 when `n` is less than or equal to 1 (factorial of 0 or 1 is 1). In the recursive case, it multiplies `n` by the factorial of `n-1` until it reaches the base case.
Main Function:The main function reads a non-negative integer input from the user. It checks if the input is valid (non-negative). If the input is negative, it displays an error message and exits.It then calculates the factorial of the input using both the iterative and recursive functions.The results of both calculations are displayed to the user.
The program then returns 0, indicating successful execution. If you have any questions about how factorial calculation works or need further explanation on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
