 The code includes the iostream and string libraries for input/output operations and string handling, respectively.
 A class named "Student" is defined, which contains three properties (data members):name: to store the student's name (string type). rollNumber: to store the student's roll number (integer type). age: to store the student's age (integer type).
 Within the class, there is a member function named displayInfo() that prints out the student's information (name, roll number, and age) to the console.
 In the main function: Two instances (objects) of the Student class, s1 and s2, are created to represent two students.Properties (name, rollNumber, age) are set for each student using the object's member variables.
 The program then displays the information for each student by calling the displayInfo() function for each student object.
 Finally, the program returns 0, indicating successful execution.
